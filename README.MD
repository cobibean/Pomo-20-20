# 20-20-20 Focus Timer

A minimal, production-ready Pomodoro timer that incorporates the 20-20-20 eye break rule to help protect your eyes during focused work sessions.

## The Cycle

1. **Focus**: 25 minutes of deep work
2. **Eye Break**: 20 seconds to look at something ~20 feet away
3. **Rest Break**: 5 minutes to stand up, stretch, and reset

Then the cycle repeats indefinitely.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).
